  This build is for the HUZZAH FEATHER ESP8266 Adafruit board (HFE)
  *Will later be adapted for the new Adafruit HUZZAH ESP32 FEATHER (HE32)

  ****************** Description ********************

  Core Sketchfile to accomplish the following:
  
  This will be a prototype sensor array to monitor temp/humi, motion, sound,
  and light, report that data back to a Raspberry Pi "Zone Controller Brain" (ZCB),
  and also provide a basic touchscreen user interface for directect remote interaction
  to the ZCB.
  
  The purpose is to make realtime and dynamic decisions that will interact with
  electronic damper controls and a Nest smart thermostat system.
  
  Version control:
  
  / + completed  - pending  ! acknowledged bug  * self note /

  vA0.1.1 - First steps

  -Rewrite working code in personally preffered format
  *will need a compile test after re-write
  +Rewrite comments and docs accordingly
  +Break out sensors/devices into their own libraries
  +Reconfigure correct wireless settings
  +Replace wasteful delay() function with proto threading

  vA0.1.0 - Test/Demo

  +Configure local wireless settings
  +Initialize the HTH
  +Open a feed session with http://io.adafruit.com
  +Push data points to io.adafruit feed on timer
